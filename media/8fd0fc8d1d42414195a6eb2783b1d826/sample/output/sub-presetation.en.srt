 Hello everyone, today I, am going to do a presentation on how to convert a PowerPoint file into a presentation video. 

2 
00:00:7,600 --> 00:00:15,200 
 The process take a several stages, turning the PowerPoint file into images, turning the speaker note into audio files. 

3 
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,800 
 Using the images to create a video and finally combine the audio with the video. 

4 
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,000 
 The images stages 

5 
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:29,200 
 For this stages, I, am using Comtypes library in Python to export each slide as a PNG file. 

6 
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,200 
 The prose is easy to use and the exported pictures are high solution. 

7 
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,500 
 The cons is this will online work on window and required user to install PowerPoint. 

8 
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,800 
 The audio stages 

9 
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,500 
 In this step, we actually have many different types of Python libraries to support the conversion. 

10 
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,900 
 At first, I tried Google TDS but the voice was very stiff, rough and fake. 

11 
00:00:51,900 --> 00:01:0,700 
 After that, I learned about PyTDS, the male voice is quite good with many improvements such as light accents and being able to customize the reading speed. 

12 
00:01:0,700 --> 00:01:5,700 
 However, I'd like to find a library with better support and a more human like voice. 

13 
00:01:5,700 --> 00:01:9,100 
 I tried TDS library by CoQi.ai. 

14 
00:01:9,100 --> 00:01:15,000 
 By using pre-trained AI models, it can create female voices with clear accents and punctuation. 

15 
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,400 
 After testing on a few models, I feel most satisfied with Tacotron 2DCA. 

16 
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:27,200 
 In addition, it also allows users to train their own AI, but that takes a lot of resources and time. 

17 
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,600 
 First, I used PPTX library to extract all speaker notes in each slide. 

18 
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,000 
 Then, using the AI model to convert texts into audio files. 

19 
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,100 
 Finally, we combine all of the audio files into a single one using audio segment library. 

20 
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,400 
 The video stages. 

21 
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:51,700 
 Using the MoviePy library, I am able to create separate clips with different duration for each images. 

22 
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,200 
 The duration is depended on the corresponding audio file. 

23 
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,300 
 Then, by combining all the clips, I get the full video. 

24 
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:4,400 
 Now, the final step is adding the full audio file into the video and save. 

25 
00:02:4,400 --> 00:02:6,500 
 Thank you for listening.
